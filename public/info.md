# 11th Annual Houston Indoor Tournament

## About

Winter is upon us. It's cold and rainy; must be time for a fun, competitive
indoor Ultimate tournament!

It’s a fast-paced, compact style of play, with a Swiss-style format (see below).
Indoor allows for a lot of creative throws and provides a great community scene
with 8 teams socializing while 2 teams play.

Indoor is truly a unique ultimate experience that you and your friends won’t
want to miss.

## Registration

Assemble your squad (or contact Matt Lyle (<mblyle@gmail.com>) if you would like
to be put on one) for Houston's 11th Annual Indoor Ultimate Tournament.

Registration is now open.

## When

**Sunday, Feb 28, 2016**

**9:00am - 6:00pm**

## Location

[7115 Clarewood, Houston TX, 77036]

**A note on the venue**: The first 10 years of the event were held at Kicks
Indoor.  Unfortunately, Kicks has closed its doors, so we were forced to
relocate to a new site at [Indoor Soccer 59].  The facility has more social
space, sells food and beer on site, and has a field similar to the size of
Kicks.

## Teams Structure

**12 Coed teams**

**3-2 or 2-3 format, offense decides**

Roster limit is 11 players per team, Game play is 5-on-5, normal subbing New for
2016: We are pushing for an extra lady on the field!  Previous years have been a
4/1 or 3/2 format. With a women's club team, 3 coed teams, and a college women's
team all in Houston, it is apropos to change the gender ratio to a more "true"
coed format to balance play for everyone.

## Format

[Swiss Draw](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swiss-system_tournament)

This is a format that we have used the past several years that is designed to
allow all teams a fair position in the event (seeding is nearly irrelevant), and
create highly competitive match ups each round.  

## Cost

**$250 per team**

Please PayPal mblyle@gmail.com -- only personal PayPal and no credit cards, as
